This is CI CD Pipeline repository Labs for me to experiment and to follow the tutorial at [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@michaelekpang/creating-a-ci-cd-pipeline-using-github-actions-b65bb248edfe)



# What I Learned 

1. How to setup CI/CD pipeline by adding .yml file at .github/workflows folder (in this case ci.yml)
2. Learned the structure of the .yml workflow for github CI
3. How to add CI badge at README file. by passing this url format:
```
![](https://github.com/<username/organisation name>/<repo name>/workflows/<workflow name, in this case ci , from ci.yml>/badge.svg)
```

4. Excercising some markdown syntax (links, header, badge links)
